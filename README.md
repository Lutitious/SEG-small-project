# Epic 1
## Part 1
1) Students can sign themselves up as (student) users of the system
2) Once they have signed up, they can log in using their email and password
3) After logging in, a student can request a set of lessons.
Such a request specifies the student's availability, the number of lessons, the interval between lessons
(usually one lesson every 1 or 2 weeks), the duration of each lesson (usually 30, 45, or 60 minutes),
and some further information (e.g. what the student wants to learn or the name of a teacher if they have one in mind).
## Part 2
4) Administrators have access to lists of fulfilled and unfulfilled requests for lessons.
5) They fulfil a lesson request by booking the lessons.  Based on the student's request, the administrator specifies the day and time of the week of a lesson, the teacher, the start date, the duration of each lesson, the interval between lessons, and the number of lessons.
6) The system calculates a price for the lessons.
## Part 3
7) Students access the status of their requests. Before the lessons are booked, they can only access their request, edit it, or delete it.
8) After the lessons are booked, the request can no longer be edited or deleted by the student.
9) At this time, the student can see a list of their lesson bookings, and they can access an invoice for their lessons.
10) If the student wishes to change their booking at this time, they need to contact a school administrator outside of the application.
11) Administrators can still edit lesson bookings or delete lessons.
12) Any changes they make to a booking are reflected in the associated invoice.
## Part 4
13) The system ensures each request is fulfilled only once. However, it is not necessary to check whether the schedule of lessons is feasible (e.g. whether teachers are double booked).
## Part 5
14) Students can only pay via bank transfer. The application is not used to take payments
15) Each student has a unique reference number. Each invoice also has a unique reference number that consists of the student reference number followed by a dash ("-") followed by the invoice number.  For example, invoice number 0129-002 is invoice number 002 for student number 0129.
16) Students enter the invoice number as the reference for their bank transfer.
17) Administrators regularly check the school's bank account for incoming transfers. All such transfers are recorded on the Music School Management System.
## Part 6
18) Administrators can check the balance for each student and their transactions (invoices and payments).
19) Students can check their balance with the music school and their own transactions (invoices and payments).
## Part 7
20) For security reasons, administrator accounts cannot be set up by signing up. Instead, they are created by the director, who has a super-administrator account.
21) This means the director can do what an administrator can. In addition, the director can create, edit, and delete administrator accounts and assign super-administrator privileges to a regular administrator account.
